Footpad Switch

The application is intended to be used with a hardware radio frequency foot switch to activate 
a usb device which acts as a HID keyboard sending an alt/F12 key code. 
If you install the app in Program Files folder, you should start the app as an administrator to 
allow writing the config file or install somewhere you have write priviledges.
Once you start the app, it saves current mouse position after you press ctrl/F12 and uses it as 
location to simulate a click after detecting alt/F12. This means that to configure a place on the
screen where to simulate mouse click, place your mouse cursor and hit ctrl/F12. After that, 
to simulate mouse click, just press the footpad which will send alt/F12.
